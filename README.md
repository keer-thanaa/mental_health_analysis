# 🧠 Mental Health Analysis – Day 3

This is Day 3 of my data exploration journey, where I analyze a mental health dataset to explore how different factors influence treatment-seeking behavior.

---
## 📂 Files Included

- `survey.csv` – The original dataset used for analysis
- `mental_health Analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with code
- `README.md` – This file

## 📊 What I Explored

I focused on how:
- **Profession** (Tech vs Self-employed vs Rural)
- **Family history of mental illness**

affect the likelihood of someone seeking mental health treatment.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 💼 Profession and Access

- People working in **tech companies** are far more likely to go for treatment.
- Individuals who are **self-employed** or living in **rural areas** are less likely to get treated.
- This may be due to:
  - Better **access** to mental health resources in tech
  - Or **limited awareness or acceptance** in rural/self-employed sectors

### 🧬 Family History Makes a Difference

- Around **75%** of individuals with a **family history** of mental illness seek treatment.
- This indicates that **personal exposure and generational awareness** play a big role in encouraging mental health support.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 What's Next?

This project sharpened my understanding of how to communicate insights with data. Tomorrow, I’ll explore a new dataset to build my skills further!
